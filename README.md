# License Plate Detector and Reader V2

**An advanced license plate detection system made by Bhargav Raj, It utilizes yolov8 models and easyocr to detect and read license plates**

## How does it work
**There are a few steps involved before we read and detect the license plate, below those are mentioned.**
- Loading of models (Model 1: This is to read the license plates-Model 3: EasyOcr)
- Opening the camera (can utilize images and videos)
- Detecting license plates then preprocessing it
- Feeding the preprocessed cropped license plate to the OCR model
- Output

**These are just the basic steps in making a license plate detection and reader system, You can make this more advanced and accurate</br>However, this gives us the basic overview on how to make a license plate detection and reader system.**

## What has improved
**The setup remains unchanged, but the model has improved significantly, with many noticeable changes in the code itself.**

## Why not update the previous repositry
**I chose to create a separate repository for v2 to keep it distinct from v1.**
